Use React.js

### Status
Decided

### Group
ux

### Assumptions

### Constraints
There's no constraint

### Positions
- Use any other JS framework that handles a virtual DOM.
- Write own js library to allow visualize documents in the browser and edit them.

### Argument
React.js is one of most popular libraries and has vast ecosystem. It has multiple libraries to handle documents in the browser and there's a large talent pool available.
