# Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

An architecture decision record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architecture decision made along with its context and consequences.

In this folder you can find all the ADRs related to the Document Hub project. This project follows the decision description template published in ["Architecture Decisions: Demystifying Architecture" by Jeff Tyree and Art Akerman, Capital One Financial.](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~chung/SA/zz-Impreso-architecture_decisions-tyree-05.pdf) with some variations to do it more simple. I also took some inspiration from template created by [Mychael Nygard in Documenting architecture decisions.](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
